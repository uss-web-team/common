## Exercise

### Getting Started

Create a working copy of the [HTML template](css1.html).

The source of this html is borrowed from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1162/1162-h/1162-h.htm).

In this exercise, you are going to make the html look much nicer than Gutenberg does.

### General text formatting

Add new CSS code for the `<body>` tag.

```css
body {
  /* your properties go here */
}
```

Set the following properties to values you think look good:

* `width`
* `margin`
* `font-family`
* `font-size`
* `color`
* `line-height`
* `text-align`
* `letter-spacing`

Read the following articles for ideas:

* readability

When you're done, show your work to a coworker and get their feedback.
