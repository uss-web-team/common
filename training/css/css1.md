## Exercise

### Getting Started

Create a working copy of the [HTML template](css1.html).

The source of this html is borrowed from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1162/1162-h/1162-h.htm).

In this exercise, you are going to make the html look much nicer than Gutenberg does.

### General text formatting

Add new CSS code for the `<body>` tag.

```css
body {
  /* your properties go here */
}
```

Set the following properties to values you think look good:

* `width`
* `margin`
* `font-family`
* `font-size`
* `line-height`
* `text-align`
* `letter-spacing`
* `color`
* `background-color`

To get some ideas, read this [blog post](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/4-tips-and-tricks-for-more-legible-content/) on readability in web documents.

### Fonts



### Selectors

Add new CSS code to make all paragraphs except the first indented.

```css
p + p {
  /* your code goes here */
}
```

Add new CSS code to make the first letter of the first paragraph of the chapter stand out.

You may find the W3C documentation on [Selectors](http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/CSS/Selectors) helpful.

### Feedback

When you're done, show your work to a coworker and get their feedback. Make changes so that everyone is happy.
