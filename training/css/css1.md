## Exercise

### Getting Started

Create a working copy of the [HTML template](css1.html).

The source of this html is borrowed from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1162/1162-h/1162-h.htm).

In this exercise, you are going to make the html look much nicer than Gutenberg does.

### Selectors

Add CSS code for the `<body>` tag.
